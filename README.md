# Getting started with MERN

### in terminal: `docker-compose up`

(`docker-compose up --build` if you need to start over)

### \* It will spin up and run a `M`ongo database, a `E`xpress server image and `R`eact client image both running `N`ode16

### \* The client is vanilla react based on Create-react-app with hot reloading

### \* The server is an express server started in nodemon so it also has hot-reloading, but requires a browser refresh

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
  You may see any lint errors in the console.
- Open [http://localhost:5000/tester](http://localhost:5000/tester) to test api in server/index.js file
